#PS1: The PS1 (Prompt Statement One) prompt is displayed before each command; 
# it is also known as the primary prompt. It is basically the first string that
# you see at the command line that tells you information (that you can customize) 
# about the current shell environment. You use the PS1 variable when you want to 
# customize this primary prompt with specific information or specific colors.
#PS2: The PS2 prompt is the secondary prompt and is shown when waiting for a user
# input. It is an indication that the shell is waiting for an input in order to 
# complete or execute a command (continuation prompt). You use the PS2 prompt when 
# a command is multi-lined or when, due to a specific syntax, requires input on the 
# next line. You can also modify the single character used to indicate the continuation 
# of a line into the next line (usually '>' is used) and the style.
#PS3: The PS3 prompt is used with the 'select' command when waiting for a user input based 
# on a assortment of choices/selections/menu options. The PS3 prompt is used when the select
# command is used to display an interactive menu of choices and when waiting for the respective
# input.
#PS4: The PS4 prompt is used when executing the debugging mode for BASH -x [script.sh]. The debug mode
# helps track down where an error might have occurred by showing each line before it is executed.
# The default -x debugging mode uses '++', whereas you can use PS4 to customize it with more information
# like line number or script name ($LINENO and $0, respectively).
